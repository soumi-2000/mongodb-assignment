# mongodb-assignment
A small preliminary task on MongoDB to demonstrate CRUD Operations using call back functions.
Promise Library was giving rise to static errors, hence I've used call back functions for now, after taking proper permission.
To reduce space and complexity, all operations have been shown in single file, i.e., app.js.
